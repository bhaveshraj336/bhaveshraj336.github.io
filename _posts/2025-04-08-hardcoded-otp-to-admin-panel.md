Have you ever tried something so simple during testing that it felt almost *too* silly to work?

Well, I did. And it unlocked the admin panel.

Let me explain.

## The Setup

I was testing the login flow of a web application. It used an OTP-based authentication system‚Äînothing unusual. You enter your email or phone number, get a 6-digit OTP, enter it, and you're in.

While going through the flow, I thought:  
> "What if the developer left a hardcoded OTP for testing?"

So I tried the classic: `111111`.

No joke‚Äî**I got in.**

Straight to the admin dashboard. No rate-limiting, no alerts, no second factor. Just full access like I owned the place.

## Why This Happened

Digging deeper, I realized this was a leftover from development. Some developer had probably set `111111` as a universal test OTP. Maybe it made local testing easier. But somehow, **that logic made it to production**.

This isn‚Äôt uncommon. During development, shortcuts like:
- Hardcoded credentials
- Master OTPs or bypass codes
- Disabled security checks

...help speed things up. But the real risk kicks in when those shortcuts aren‚Äôt removed before go-live.

## The Impact

In this case, the OTP wasn't scoped to a test user. It worked **for anyone**, including privileged accounts.

This meant:
- Account takeover with zero friction
- Full admin access to the application
- Potential to modify, delete, or extract sensitive data

Had a malicious actor discovered this, it could've led to serious business and user impact.

## The Takeaway

What did I learn (and what should *you* take away)?

- **Always test the obvious.** Never assume something is ‚Äútoo dumb to work.‚Äù Try the simple things.
- **Developers need secure coding checklists.** Test credentials or backdoors should *never* reach production.
- **Code reviews and staging-to-production pipelines must include security checks.**
- **Security is everyone's responsibility**‚Äînot just the pentester‚Äôs.

## Final Thoughts

This bug reminded me that some of the most powerful vulnerabilities hide behind the *simplest inputs*. And honestly? That's what makes bug hunting fun. üôÇ

Let me know‚Äîhave you ever found something critical by trying something basic?
